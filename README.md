<h1>Ranked Choice Voting</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The Ranked Choice Voting project provides an implementation of a modern voting system that allows voters to express their preferences more flexibly. Popularized in various electoral contexts, including New York City’s mayoral primaries in 2021, Ranked Choice Voting enables voters to rank candidates in order of preference rather than simply selecting one. This approach reduces the likelihood of “vote splitting” among similar candidates and promotes a more representative electoral outcome.
